#LANDMARK is an HTML-only project focused on building strong website foundations through semantic structure, accessibility, and clear content hierarchy.
This project is part of my ongoing 12-week learning and building sprint, where I’m intentionally strengthening frontend fundamentals before introducing styling and interactivity.

The goal of LANDMARK is to practice writing meaningful, well-structured HTML that mirrors real-world websites 
emphasizing how users and browsers understand content, not just how it looks.

What This Project Covers
Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, footer)
Clear page structure and content hierarchy
Accessibility-minded markup
Logical navigation and readable content flow
Clean, organized document structure

Key Takeaways
Good HTML structure improves accessibility and usability
Strong foundations make future styling and scripting easier
Semantic landmarks help both users and assistive technologies
Simplicity leads to maintainability

LANDMARK will serve as the structural base for upcoming projects where CSS and JavaScript will be progressively introduced.
